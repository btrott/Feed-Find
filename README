NAME
    Feed::Find - Syndication feed auto-discovery

SYNOPSIS
        use Feed::Find;
        my @feeds = Feed::Find->find('http://example.com/');

DESCRIPTION
    *Feed::Find* implements feed auto-discovery for finding syndication
    feeds, given a URI. It (currently) passes all of the auto-discovery
    tests at *http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/autodiscovery/*.

    *Feed::Find* will discover the following feed formats:

    *   RSS 0.91

    *   RSS 1.0

    *   RSS 2.0

    *   Atom

USAGE
  Feed::Find->find($uri)
    Given a URI *$uri*, use a variety of techniques to find the feeds
    associated with that page. If *$uri* itself points to a feed (i.e., if
    the *Content-Type* of the response is a recognized feed type), returns
    *$uri*.

    Returns a list of feed URIs.

    The following techniques are used:

    1. *<link>* tag auto-discovery
        If the page contains any *<link>* tags in the *<head>* section,
        these tags are examined for recognized feed content types. The
        following content types are treated as feeds:
        *application/x.atom+xml*, *application/atom+xml*, *application/xml*,
        *text/xml*, *application/rss+xml*, and *application/rdf+xml*.

    2. Scanning *<a>* tags
        If the page does not contain any known *<link>* tags, the page is
        then scanned for *<a>* tags for links to URIs with certain file
        extensions. The following extensions are treated as feeds: .rss,
        .xml, and .rdf.

        Note that this technique is employed only if the first technique
        returns no results.

  Feed::Find->find_in_html($html [, $base_uri ])
    Given a string *$html* containing an HTML page, uses the same techniques
    as described above in *find* to find the feeds associated with that
    page.

    If you know the URI of the page, you should provide it in *$base_uri*,
    so that relative links can be properly made absolute. *Feed::Find* will
    attempt to determine the correct base URI, but unless that URI is
    specified in the HTML itself (in a "<meta>" tag), you'll need to supply
    it yourself.

    Returns a list of feed URIs.
